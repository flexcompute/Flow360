    - `None` entities will be expanded (or just ignored and convert to global default, depending on implementation)

    need to have dedicated field for global settings. This is also consistent with the `FluidDynamics` class' design.

    - For `SurfaceRefinement` we may need validation to detect if default has been set or not. This is because we need
    these defaults so that the when face name is not present, what config we ues. Depending on how we go down the road.
