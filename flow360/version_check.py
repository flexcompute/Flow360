This module provides utility functions for handling client versions.

Classes:
- VersionSupported: Enumeration representing the different states of version support.

Functions:
- get_supported_server_versions(None) -> List[str]: Fetches a list of supported versions from the server.
- check_client_version(None) -> Tuple[VersionSupported, Union[str, Version]]: 
    Checks the current client version against the available versions.
- client_version_get_info(None) -> None: Logs information about the client version.

Constants:
- YES: VersionSupported enum value indicating that the version is supported.
- NO: VersionSupported enum value indicating that the version is no longer supported.
- CAN_UPGRADE: VersionSupported enum value indicating that an upgrade is available.
